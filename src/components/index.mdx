# Higher Order Component Toolbox

This library is designed to encourage cleaner React codebases by avoiding some of the less readable hacks that React developers use frequently.

Instead of doing this:

```jsx
  <div>
    {true && (
      <div>Some conditional text</div>
    )}
  </div>
```

It makes code much more readable and reusable to use smarter components like this:
```jsx
  <If condition={true}>
    <div>Some conditional text</div>
  </If>
```
